title: "New year, new goals"

2016 has arrived. I'm not a big fan of New Year's resolutions, because for me (almost) every moment is good to change something, start or stop doing some things. But the fact is that we can achieve more if we make plans. Even though not all of them will come to fruition, it's still better to have some plans than to not know which direction we are going. So the coming of a new year can be a great opportunity to think about all the things that we would like to accomplish in the following year. Plus it gives us a handy time frame. We can say: "By the end of 2016 I'd like to...", so we keep in mind that we have a limited time for our goals and every lazy day slowly drift us away from our dreams. One of the most important thing in planning is writing everything down. These days people are overwhelmed by so much information and have so many things to do that we simply forget about our priorities. Writing down our plans lets us get back to them every time we feel lost and correct our course. So if we don't remember what to do next, then a sheet of paper (or a blog) remembers that for us.

This blog is mainly about web development so I won't be boring you with my personal plans. I'll stick to programming. In 2016 I decided to focus on Javascript and its frameworks. So my plans are as follows:

* learn Javascript
* practice codding in Javascript
* get a job as a Javascript developer

Looks simple? Yeah, it does. But Javascript is a really complex subject and getting familiar with all the details and good practices takes some time. There are plenty of JS frameworks and each of them looks like a small separate language. But I'm very optimistic and I know with hard work and passion I can make this plans come true. Right now I'm studying a couple of books about JS and doing some online courses so everything's on the right track.

Besides Javascript I would like to start learning a few other things too. Let me just write here the names of these frameworks/technologies:

\- Angular  
\- Node.js  
\- MongoDB  
\- React

Generally these are my priorities for 2016 when it comes to programming. Obviously I'll make these plans more specific and prepare a step by step path with timestamps. At the end of 2016 I'll try to make a small summary of what I've done throughtout this year. But in the meantime you can expect a lot of articles relating to web development industry. Stay tuned!
